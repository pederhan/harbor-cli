# Introduction

Harbor CLI is a command line tool for Harbor. It is used to manage Harbor projects, repositories, artifacts, users, and more.

Harbor CLI is powered by [harborapi](https://github.com/pederhan/harborapi) and attempts to follow the Harbor API specification as closely as possible. This means you should be able to expect the same behavior and results from the CLI as you would from the API in most cases.

<!-- Harbor CLI is written in Python, and is available on PyPI.  -->
